# Machine Learning for Survival Analysis
**Survival analysis, as an important and independent subject studied and practiced
in different industries for decades, has been through an intelligent transformation.**
My name is 
[Cheng Jiaxiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaxiang-cheng/), a Ph.D. student working at 
[SP Group-NTU Joint Lab](http://eeeweba.ntu.edu.sg/power_projects/SPGroup-NTU/0_default.asp), Singapore.
Machine learning application in survival analysis is my current research topic.
This repository will summarize all my research work ready for public access.
